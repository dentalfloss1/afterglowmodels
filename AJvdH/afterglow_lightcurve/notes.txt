for SGRB 051221A, epsilon_e of 0.015 is favored over a higher value.
This shifts the peak to an earlier time
A density of 1e-4 is favored
Identical settings for SGRB 210919A mean it should detectable
Even at lower densities it should be detectable. 
BUT the peak time is SUPER early, 0.1 days or so.
This is all at 8.5 GHz. Will look at L band next


Should be visible in L band BUT GRB200219A should also
be visible in L-band. Which may imply that GRB200219A has something else going on
perhaps an even lower density environment.
